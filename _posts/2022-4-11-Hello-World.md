# Where am I?
In reality, I'm probably working -- ICS & SCADA Engineering is a bit of a hassle. 


## Okay and?

In any case, I'm currently working on the .md's for various CTF solves and the main landing page.


Thanks for your patience. 


I expect the site to go live sometime in Q1'23. Maybe. Happy Holidays Everyone!
