#Where am I?
In reality, I'm probably working -- ICS & SCADA Engineering is a bit of a hassle. 

As a result, this page definitely underConstruction.gif
In any case, I'm currently working on the .md's for various CTF solves and the main landing page. 

Thanks for your patience. 

I expect the site to go live by the week of May 8th, 2022.
